The REACT framework (Response Estimation and Analysis using Correlated Trajectories) is an innovative approach to space domain awareness and upper-atmosphere science. It repurposes publicly available satellite trajectory data ‚Äî specifically Two-Line Elements (TLEs) from the U.S. satellite catalog at [Space-Track.org](https://www.space-track.org/auth/login) ‚Äî to extract actionable insight into the health and behavior of low Earth orbit (LEO). Instead of treating each satellite as an independent object, REACT models the collective dynamical response of thousands of satellites and debris objects. This approach captures how the population as a whole reacts to natural forces, such as thermospheric density changes during geomagnetic storms, as well as human-driven actions, such as propulsive maneuvers.
Although TLEs were originally intended to provide near-real-time orbital knowledge for communications and tracking, their historical record across the entire satellite population is a powerful, underused data source. REACT uses this record to uncover patterns in satellite operator behavior‚Äîinformation that is rarely shared publicly‚Äîand to map changes in Earth‚Äôs upper atmosphere over time, creating a long-term, data-driven view of the thermosphere‚Äôs response to space weather.

At its core, REACT applies statistical estimation from historical correlations across the full tracked catalog of space objects in LEO. It uses ‚Äúpassive‚Äù debris populations as a distributed sensor to infer a consensus drag response to space weather, which provides a robust baseline against which individual satellites can be compared. Objects deviating significantly from this baseline can be flagged as potentially maneuvering, improving transparency in satellite operations and enabling more reliable collision-avoidance planning.

REACT also supports the scientific research community by transforming decades of historical TLE data into a high-resolution record of thermospheric mass density as a function of latitude, longitude, and time. These reconstructions provide unprecedented coverage of the upper atmosphere, supporting studies of solar-terrestrial coupling, greenhouse gas‚Äìdriven thermospheric cooling, and the impacts of space weather events on the orbital environment. The TLE dataset spans more than 50 years, and thus provides a long-term atmospheric specification for consistent comparison between space weather events across the space age.

# Use Cases
**Collision Risk Assessment:** Provides improved capability for satellite tracking and trajectory predictions during geomagnetic storms, reducing false conjunction alerts and unnecessary maneuvers.

**Transparency in Satellite Operations:** Enables third-party monitoring of maneuvering behavior using publicly available data, increasing trust and accountability in LEO.

**Thermosphere Research:** Offers a long-term, spatially resolved dataset for studying space weather impacts, atmospheric tides, and climate-driven density trends.

**Policy and Sustainability:** Supports analyses of orbital carrying capacity by quantifying how drag variability and conjunction rates change with solar cycle conditions.
